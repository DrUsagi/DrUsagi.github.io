I am a PhD student in Computer Information Systems at the [J. Mack Robinson College of Business](https://robinson.gsu.edu/), Georgia State University. I am fortunate to work with an exceptional team of advisors: [Balasubramaniam Ramesh](https://robinson.gsu.edu/profile/balasubramaniam-ramesh/), [Xinyu Fu](https://sherryfu0315.github.io/), and [JJ Hsieh](https://www.jjhsieh.com/).

Research Interests
======
My research focuses on two main areas:

1. **Human-AI Collaboration**, including:
   - Human-AI Ensembles
   - Delegation between humans and AI systems

2. **Impact of Generative AI (GenAI)** within the corporate finance setting

I employ a diverse methodological toolkit, including: Analytical modeling, Design science, and Experimental methods.

Background
======
Before diving into academia, I spent seven years working in principal investment and private equity. The longer I worked, the more I realized: what really fascinated me wasn't the finance and investing itself, but rather the assets behind those investment decisions and the transformative technologies driving them. I became captivated by how technology innovations were reshaping the world and revolutionizing the business landscape. That's what led me to shift my focus from finance to studying how IT and AI technologies impact organizations and society—which is now at the heart of my research!

Beyond Academia
======
When I'm not immersed in research, I enjoy:
- **Photography**: I'm a professional photographer
- **Motorcycling**: I'm a semi-professional motorcycle rider
- **Music**: I love playing the violin and accordion, and I'm passionate about music from all around the world
- **Animals**: I absolutely love cats and dogs! If your furry friends are open to making new friends, I'd be delighted to introduce them to my pets.

Collaboration
======
If you share similar research interests, I'm always eager to discuss ideas, explore potential collaborations, or co-author papers. Feel free to reach out!
