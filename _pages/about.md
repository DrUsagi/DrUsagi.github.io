I am a PhD student in Computer Information Systems at the [J. Mack Robinson College of Business](https://robinson.gsu.edu/), Georgia State University. I am fortunate to work with an exceptional team of advisors: [Balasubramaniam Ramesh](https://robinson.gsu.edu/profile/balasubramaniam-ramesh/), [Xinyu Fu](https://sherryfu0315.github.io/), and [JJ Hsieh](https://www.jjhsieh.com/).

Research Interests
======
My research focuses on two main areas:

1. **Human-AI Collaboration**, including:
   - Human-AI Ensembles
   - Delegation between humans and AI systems

2. **Impact of Generative AI (GenAI)** within the corporate finance setting

I employ a diverse methodological toolkit, including:
- Analytical modeling
- Design science
- Experimental methods

Background
======
Prior to my acedmic journey, I spent seven years working in investment banking and private equity. I learned a lot about financial modeling and analysis, but here's the thing: I wasn't exactly crushing it in the investment world 😅. It wasn't because I couldn't handle the math—I'm actually pretty good with numbers 📊. The real problem? It was more about human psychology than financial formulas. That realization sparked my interest in behavioral research, which is now a big part of my work!

Beyond Academia
======
When I'm not immersed in research, I enjoy:
- **Photography**: I'm a professional photographer
- **Motorcycling**: I'm a semi-professional motorcycle rider
- **Animals**: I absolutely love cats and dogs! If your furry friends are open to making new friends, I'd be delighted to introduce them to my pets.

Collaboration
======
If you share similar research interests, I'm always eager to discuss ideas, explore potential collaborations, or co-author papers. Feel free to reach out!
