I am a PhD student in Computer Information Systems at the [J. Mack Robinson College of Business](https://robinson.gsu.edu/), Georgia State University. I am fortunate to work with an exceptional team of advisors: [Balasubramaniam Ramesh](https://robinson.gsu.edu/profile/balasubramaniam-ramesh/), [Xinyu Fu](https://sherryfu0315.github.io/), and [JJ Hsieh](https://www.jjhsieh.com/).

Research Interests
======
My research focuses on two main areas:

1. **Human-AI Collaboration**, including:
   - Human-AI Ensembles
   - Delegation between humans and AI systems

2. **Impact of Generative AI (GenAI)** within the corporate finance setting

I employ a diverse methodological toolkit, including:
- Analytical modeling
- Design science
- Experimental methods

Background
======
Prior to my academic journey, I spent seven years working in private equity investment. While I gained valuable experience in financial modeling and analysis, I came to realize that my challenges in investment weren't primarily due to technical limitations in finance mathematics, but rather behavioral factors. This realization sparked my deep interest in behavioral research, which now informs my academic work.

Beyond Academia
======
When I'm not immersed in research, I enjoy:
- **Photography**: I'm a professional photographer
- **Motorcycling**: I'm a semi-professional motorcycle rider
- **Animals**: I absolutely love cats and dogs! If your furry friends are open to making new friends, I'd be delighted to introduce them to my pets.

Collaboration
======
If you share similar research interests, I'm always eager to discuss ideas, explore potential collaborations, or co-author papers. Feel free to reach out!
