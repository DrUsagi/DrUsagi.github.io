This course provides a comprehensive introduction to Agentic AI, exploring the principles, architectures, and applications of autonomous AI systems that can reason, plan, and act independently.

## Course Overview

Agentic AI represents a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, moving from reactive systems to proactive agents capable of autonomous decision-making and goal-oriented behavior. This course covers:

- **Foundational Concepts**: Understanding what makes an AI system "agentic"
- **Architectural Patterns**: Agent frameworks, multi-agent systems, and orchestration
- **Reasoning and Planning**: How agentic systems make decisions and plan actions
- **Tool Use and Delegation**: Integration with external tools and APIs
- **Applications**: Real-world use cases in business, research, and industry

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. Understand the fundamental principles of agentic AI systems
2. Design and implement basic agentic AI architectures
3. Evaluate the trade-offs between different agentic approaches
4. Apply agentic AI concepts to solve real-world problems
